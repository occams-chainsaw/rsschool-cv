## English skills

**C1 ADVANCED**

I've never taken any additional courses/seminars besides academic courses and I've never considered it necessary, because my work as a translator implies delving into the pecularities of language that are never touched upon in these additional courses. My knowledge is based mostly on practice and experience, as well as reading, listening to and watching various content in English.
